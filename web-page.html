    <h1>sik worlds</h1>
    <p>The reflection of my face, some wouldn't even recognize
Or who put me in this place, I wouldn't even recognize
Time has been so cruel, I could've blamed me but I blame you
I do...<br>


Lately I feel lost, tell me if you find me
It's hard to put the past behind me
When my mind just sits there and keeps reminding
Me of all the bullshit that I kept inside me<br>

I'm not lying when I tell you I feel like I'm lost
It just feels like I trapped in my thoughts
I just sit there and think, and I think, and I think
And I think and I think, I lost it all<br>
    </p>
